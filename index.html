                                    <p>Winter Resort Simulator Season 2 is a realistic and authentic simulation of a ski resort.
                                        All vehicles and ropeways are built close to their counterpart in the real world.
                                        The player takes the role of the manager of a ski resort. Snowcats, Ropeways and other vehicles
                                        are waiting for the player to help with the daily tasks of the resort. The game is avaible on Steam for PC!</p>

                        <h3>My journey in the project</h3>
                        <p>I joined the team half a year before the anticipated release date. My task was to improve and expand the design of the game.
                            The new version of the game needed a playable character, new UI, redesigned assets and ropeways.
                            At first, I started sculpting a male character base, created clothes and assets for it.
                            After that, I had to retopologize the character in order to meet the poly count needed that the game would run effortlessly.
                            That was kind of a challenge, because the game would need really low poly counts to run stable.
                            So I needed to use a workflow to preserve as many details as possible.
                            I baked details from high to low in Substance. After that, I hand painted the skin, clothes and created materials for the later use in Unity.
                            The same workflow was used for the female player character and NPCs as well - only with the difference that the NPCs needed LODs as well.
                            In the further course of the project, I was responsible for the new UI main menu design.
                        </p>

                    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
                        <img loading=lazy src="./img/wrs/wrs-ui-design.jpg" class="embed-responsive-item"
                            alt="pictures of ui">
                    </div>
                    <div class="px-3 my-3">
                        <p>The old UI needed an overhaul, so I took the challenge and started creating a new design for the updated version of the game. I took reference from
                            similar games and tried to create a design, that would fit into the genre of simulation games. I had no specific education in UI design, so I started
                            teaching myself about it. I tried make it as simple as possible. The color scheme (dark grey, orange, white) fitted perfectly for the big tiles. I kept them
                            slightly transparent to make the background more apparent. The feeling of winter should be apparent in every aspect of the game, even in the main menu.
                            I took the flasing orange color from the logo and used it as accent color.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Texturing, texutring and more texturing...</h3>
                        <p>
                            Next to my work on the UI design and character, I started reworking some of the excisting textures and creating new textures for the brand new vehicles,
                            ropeways and other assets. For that I used Substance Painter. The game as simulation demanded a high grad of realism in the textures itself. I looked
                            for references in the internet, searched for machines and materials and applied the knowledge in my work. I created textures for the new snow vehicle (Prinoth),
                            a new ropeway that came into the game after the update, updated textures for the renewed NPCs and painted the skin of my characters.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Art meets Tech' Stuff: Rigging and Animation</h3>
                        <p>
                            After the update, the game featured visible characters due to the introduction of the multiplayer mode. So the two characters (named Bob and Alice), needed
                            all the animations to explore the snowy mountains of Hallstein. I rigged the characters in Blender, weightpainted them and did the animations. We faced
                            some challenges with the integration inside of Unity (<span class="font-italic">because Blender -> Unity is pain sometimes. Oh boy, I learned that the hard way...</span>). I learned
                            that I needed to keep a look at all the animations inside the fbx and if everyone is exported probably. With the achieved knowledge about the pain of
                            exporting animation, I turned to Alice, the female character. I tried to make the rig more simple so it would export more easily. I applied the same
                            animations I created for the male character, but changed them to fit them better to her body and female movement.

                                    <p>Taiji is currently a work in progress project. This 3D animation movie project
                                        originated during my
                                        master studies (University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria - Digital Arts)
                                        and is realized with the help of two other artists: <a

                                    <h3>Story</h3>
                                    <p>The movie is about a young monk whom we called Djin.
                                        He follows an amulett which leads him through the forest to an old temple.
                                        All vegetation is dead and weathered. In the temple he needs to execute a ritual
                                        including the four
                                        elements to bring nature back to life. The elements are embodied by four
                                        statues, one for each element.
                                        A bonsai in the middle of the temple represents nature. While Djin performs the
                                        ritual, something goes wrong
                                        and he risks his life to save it.</p>
                                    <p>To give some insights into my project, you can find some examples of my work on
                                        this project here.
                                        At the moment, I am mainly responsible for animation. But at the conception

                                        were both working on the over all concept and idea of the movie. It all started
                                        with a simple idea of two
                                        monchs on two tall mountains, controlling the elements in order to save their
                                        own land.
                                        The idea took on a life of its own and gradually transformed into the story as

                                    <p>NaN0x is some kind of Artificial Intelligence which tries to communicate with
                                        human beings about what she wants.
                                        Different visual and audio-visual cues indicate how NaN0x currently feels. If
                                        nobody does what NaN0x wants,
                                        she will start to get angry. NaN0x impatiently waits for the present people to
                                        fulfill her will and will react even angrier than before -
                                        until her system crashes and reboots. If the people achieve to make NaN0x happy,
                                        it won’t take long until she has new demands for them.</p>

                                    <h3>Idea behind</h3>
                                    <p>In recent years AI and algorithms have taken over our day to day life. Smart Home
                                        devices for example help us with everyday tasks, but sometimes they do not
                                        understand us,
                                        which causes us to repeat ourselves over and over again. We even try to
                                        pronounce the sentence differently and wrong so that we are understood by the
                                        AI.
                                        Other systems like self-driving cars do the parking for us, smart assistants on
                                        smartphones plan our calendar.
                                        These are just some examples of how we hand over control over our lives to
                                        machines. .</p>

                            communicate it to the people participating in this experience. Of course, NaNox needed to be
                            appealing so we looked out for a vibe that
                            makes the player believe, that NaNox is an actual AI.
                            This project was realized in my Master's Study Digital Arts with my project partner Johannes
                            Lugstein.
                            He was also responsible for the coding part, helping out with the more difficult part of it.
                            We both were responsible for developing the idea and realizing the whole project.

                                    <h3>About 'Hast an Vogl?!</h3>
                                    <p>This project was created in the course of the study "Digital Arts" at the
                                        University of Applied Sciences Hagenberg.
                                        With the help of two fellow students we produced this hand-drawn animation
                                        within 3 months.</p>

                                    <h3>Idea behind</h3>
                                    <p>Every person has their rough edges. Some are more closed, so these special sides
                                        show up less often in these people and are more
                                        difficult to recognize. Sometimes you can't stand these sides of yourself or
                                        suffer from them. In this story we want to tell
                                        that one can be a lovable personality just because of these peculiarities.</p>
                                    <p>We animated our movie with the help of Adobe Animate and After Effects. Each
                                        frame is hand drawn (12 frames per second), as well
                                        as the backgrounds in the movie. We tried to use a neutral color palette to
                                        convey a calm mood. I was responsible for the audio and
                                        sound design as well. For that I used the in-house equipment of the university
                                        to create the sounds, mix them and underlay the animation with them.
                                        On the bottom you can find the finished movie, enjoy!
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                                    <p>Animating frame by frame was quite a new challenge for me personally. I always
                                        worked
                                        in 3D animation, where you can move your characters around freely. But every
                                        frame had to
                                        be drawn by hand, so it required consistency during drawing the characters and
                                        movements.
                                        During that project I found a hidden love to hand animated movies and really
                                        enjoyed the process.

                                    <p>I was allowed to realize a presentation video for the social media platform
                                        "Gemeinsam Erleben".
                                        The project offers a platform for adventurous people who want to make new
                                        contacts and get to learn new people.
                                        New contacts are used to share hobbies together.
                                        The video can be found on the <a
                                            href="https://gemeinsamerleben.com/about">website of the project</a> and on
                                        the
                                        bottom of this page.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Concept</h3>
                                    <p>The video should also tell this story, so it was divided into three acts.
                                        The first one shows rather bored people who obviously long for excitement and
                                        adventure.
                                        This look was reinforced by overdrawing the characters in black and white.
                                        After that, the explanation of the project should take place. Here, attention
                                        was paid to
                                        clips that showed happier people. To bring momentum into the video, I relied on
                                        jump cuts here.
                                        The climax of the video consists of full video clips of people experiencing
                                        something.
                                        Since the platform covers many different areas of leisure and hobbies, the video
                                        should be clear and
                                        understandable for every user. The style should be simplistic and speaking. I
                                        decided to go for a sticker
                                        look and fast animations. In terms of color, I stuck to the basic design of
                                        "Experience Together". Further
                                        colors were discussed with the client, but I was oriented towards bright,
                                        contrasting colors.</p>

                                    alt="concept of the video">
                            </div>
                            <p class="px-3 my-2">
                                You can see the first designs that were made for the client. Here the sticker look was
                                tested and demontrated.
                                In addition, a feeling for the flow of the animations should be conveyed (video,
                                freezing, overdrawing, text).
                                The video itself was then implemented using Photoshop and After Effects. The graphics
                                that came from the videos were
                                first edited and then cut back together with the original clips. The tricky part here
                                was the right timing of the texts and animations.

                                    <h3>About Gamejams and Animatonjams</h3>
                                    <p>A game jam is a contest where participants try to make a video game from scratch.
                                        Depending on the format, participants might work independently, or in teams. The
                                        contest duration usually ranges from 24 to 72 hours.
                                        Participants are generally programmers, game designers, artists, writers, and
                                        others in game development-related fields.
                                        An animation jam works just the same. The focus here is on creating a short animation movie
                                        instead of creating a game. During my studies in Hagenberg, I participated in multiple jams.
                                        In summary, we created four games and three animation shorts during all of the jams.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Work</h3>
                                    <p>Most of the time, I was responsible for the art part of these short projects.
                                        In the nature of these jams that you take action in various parts of the project
                                        to complete it as fast as you can.
                                        So created the concepts, storyboards, designs of world and characters. I spend time
                                        animating characters in Maya and building levels in Unity. I created and edited different
                                        sounds to accentuate the right mood in the recording studio with Logic. But best of all
                                        was the fun of the project itself and the people you are working with!
                                        You can find some of these projects on the bottom, enjoy!

                                    <h3>About HoleyMoley</h3>
                                    <p>HoleyMoley is a game project that was created during my studies. In a group of two, me and 
                                        <a href="https://www.johannes-lugstein.at/">Hannes Lugstein</a> created the concept for this little
                                        game. It is about two moles rushing down a mine shaft. Two people have to steer together, to come as far 
                                        as possible. They have to use the arrow and wasd keys to lean and jump. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Endless mine shafts</h3>
                                    <p>The goal is to come as far as possible. But the twist is you need to cooperate with your partner to achieve that.
                                        The game itself gets faster the further the players come. So failure is just a part of the game. We wanted to 
                                        create a feeling of 'motivating fustration' inside of the players. It should be the kind of game that you love
                                        and hate just the same. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Unreal & Maya</h3>
                                    <p>The mine shaft is generated randomly and procedurally  while the game is running, so one round is never the same as the one before.
                                        Johannes Lugstein did the logic for the game and created the algorithm for the map creation. I modeled the assets, map parts and characters.
                                        I rigged and animated them in maya. Due to time restriction, the game itself has a rather simple art approach.
                                        We plan to work our remaining ideas into the game and improve the art style in the future.
